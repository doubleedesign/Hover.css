# Hover.css

This is a fork of [Ian Lunn's Hover](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover) customised for use in my SASS-based projects, such as WordPress themes using my [starter kit](https://github.com/doubleedesign/doublee-dev-starter-kit).

For use in your own projects please ensure you have an appropriate [license from Ian](https://ianlunn.co.uk/store/licenses/).

This project assumes that Font Awesome 6 is present in the project if using  the icon effects, and that the following variables are available:

```scss
$colours: (
    'accent': SOME_HEX_CODE
)
```
```scss
$fa-default-weight: var(--fa-font-solid); // or your choice of Font Awesome weight
```

You can override these on a use-case basis in your own CSS.
